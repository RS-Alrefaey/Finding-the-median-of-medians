# Finding-the-median-of-medians

This project has been built using Python and Tkinter for building a nice GUI. <br>
This project is about finding the median using sorting algorithms, such as QuickSort, <br>
SelectionSort, medianOfMedians and radixSort. The comparison between algorithms <br> 
depends on the performance and the time taken to show the results.<br> 
we have 10,000 auto-generated data as an entry. additionally, the data have two <br>
options when testing the algorithms, sorted and unsorted.
<br>
#### The report shows the comparisons results.
